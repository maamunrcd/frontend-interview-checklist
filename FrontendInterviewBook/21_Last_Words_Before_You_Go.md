# LAST WORDS BEFORE YOU GO

## Remember These Truths:

1. **You don't need to be perfect**
   - Even senior developers Google things
   - It's OK to not know something
   - Show how you'd find the answer

2. **Communication > Code**
   - Explain your thinking
   - Ask questions
   - Discuss trade-offs
   - Show collaboration

3. **Process > Solution**
   - How you approach problems matters
   - Show debugging skills
   - Demonstrate learning ability
   - Think systematically

4. **It's a conversation**
   - Not an interrogation
   - Not a test
   - Two-way evaluation
   - Build rapport

5. **Every interview is practice**
   - Learn from each one
   - Get better each time
   - Don't take rejection personally
   - Keep improving
