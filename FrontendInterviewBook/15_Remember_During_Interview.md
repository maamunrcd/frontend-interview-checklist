# REMEMBER DURING INTERVIEW

## DO:
✅ **Ask clarifying questions** before coding  
✅ **Think out loud** - share your reasoning  
✅ **Start simple** - core logic first  
✅ **Test your solution** with examples  
✅ **Discuss trade-offs** and alternatives  
✅ **Communicate** if you're stuck  
✅ **Stay calm** - take a breath if needed  

## DON'T:
❌ **Jump to code** without planning  
❌ **Stay silent** - interviewer can't read your mind  
❌ **Ignore edge cases** - mention them  
❌ **Give up** - show problem-solving process  
❌ **Panic** - every developer gets stuck  
❌ **Memorize without understanding**
