```

### When They Ask: "Why should we hire you?"

```
"I bring three key strengths:

1. Technical Depth: I understand not just how to use React,
   but how it works internally - reconciliation, fiber architecture,
   performance optimization.

2. Production Experience: I've debugged memory leaks in production,
   optimized applications serving 100k+ users, and implemented
   robust security practices.

3. Leadership: I mentor junior developers, conduct thorough code
   reviews, and make architectural decisions considering long-term
   maintainability.

I'm not just looking for a job - I want to contribute to building
something meaningful, and I believe my skills align perfectly with
