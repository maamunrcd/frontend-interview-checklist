## Interview Survival Kit (If You Forget Something)

| Situation | What to say |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Forgot exact syntax?** | "I don't remember the exact syntax, but the concept is..." |
| **Don't know something?** | "I haven't worked with X, but I understand Y which is similar..." or "Can you tell me more about X?" |
| **Made a mistake?** | "Actually, I see an issue here. Let me fix it..." |
| **Need time to think?** | "Let me think through this step by step..." |
| **Stuck?** | "I'm not sure about the optimal approach. Could you give me a hint?" or "Let me break this down into smaller parts..." |

**Remember:** Thinking out loud, asking questions, and showing your process matter more than perfect syntax.
