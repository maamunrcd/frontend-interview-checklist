## 🧠 The Senior Engineer Mindset (Post-AI Era)

> "Coding is increasingly becoming a commodity. Architecture and System Design are the last frontiers of true engineering value."

In an era where AI can generate components in seconds, a Senior Engineer's value is no longer in *writing* the code, but in **designing the systems** that are:
1.  **Scalable**: Can handle 10x traffic without breaking.
2.  **Maintainable**: Can be modified by other engineers without unintended side effects.
3.  **Resilient**: Handles network failures, browser crashes, and edge cases gracefully.
4.  **Performant**: Delivers a premium experience regardless of device or network quality.
